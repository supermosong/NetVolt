## How to Run Locally

No installs needed. Just open a terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

> **Why not just double-click index.html?**
> You can, but some browsers block links between local files. The Python server
> avoids that problem and makes everything work exactly like a real website.

To stop the server press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Why |
|---|---|
| HTML5 | Semantic elements, accessibility |
| CSS3 (Grid + Flexbox + custom properties) | Responsive layout, no dependencies |
| Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) | No build tools, no framework |
| Google Fonts (CDN) | Better readability |

No npm. No bundler. No framework. Open any file and it just works.

## Branches

| Branch | Purpose |

## Design Decisions

- **Dark mode first** — dark navy/charcoal background with bright accent colours
- **Mobile responsive** — works on all screen sizes
- **Accessible** — WCAG 2.1 AA (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, contrast ratios)
- **No backend** — all interactive features (quizzes, flip cards, 3D explorer) run in the browser
